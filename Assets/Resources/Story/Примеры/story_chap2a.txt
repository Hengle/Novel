narrator "Led by the kitsune girl, Raelin and Gwynne soon came to a clearing in the woods. {a}Meditating on a lone tree stump was a brown monkey that looked more like a chunk of dark meat that had been chewed up and spat back out again.{c}The very sight of it alone was nearly enough to cause Raelin's gorge to rise.{c}If this wasn't the monkey whose face needed tickling, then she may as well resort to blowing up the planet herself.{c}The kitsune bid them farewell and pranced off out of sight, leaving them alone with the alarmingly repulsive creature."

narrator "But as Raelin approached the chimp, it's meditation broke.{a} It stared up at her with souless, black eyes.{a} Staring as if daring her to lay a finger on it."
"She spoke softly, drawing her hand closer and closer to its face so as to not startle it. At this point, the monkey began to drool, eliminating and least 30% of available space where she would even be willing to touch it."
"She froze, inches from its face.{a} The saliva pooled at its feet.{c} She began to second guess it. Perhaps this was just a cruel joke Gareth was playing on her. Or maybe it really was the only way."
